# COMMAND ASSIST

Command Assist is a simple script that facilitates daily work with the console. If you have any commands that you use frequently, you can add them to a new or existing *.tsv file. After running the script, a window with the ability to search and select entered commands from a list will appear. The list is generated based on *.tsv files containing commands that are located in the help directory or its subdirectories. The fzf program is used to search and select commands.
